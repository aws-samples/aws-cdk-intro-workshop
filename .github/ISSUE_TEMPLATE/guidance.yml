        Important Information
        Please make sure you have gone through the [existing questions](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-cdk-intro-workshop/issues?utf8=âœ“&q=is%3Aissue+label%3Aguidance) before filing
        a new issue! If your question was already asked, but the answer does not satisfy
        your curiosity, prefer re-opening the existing issue to ask for further
        clarification, instead of filing a new issue.
