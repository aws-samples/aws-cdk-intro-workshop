CDK provides high level constructs (also referred to as L3 constructs) for common use case patterns across AWS services. There are 2 types of high level constructs that CDK provides:


1. AWS Solutions Constructs which are open-source extensions of the AWS Cloud Development Kit that provides multi-service, well-architected patterns for quickly defining solutions in code to create predictable and repeatable infrastructure. The goal of these constructs is to accelerate the ability for developers to build solutions of any size using pattern-based definitions for their architecture
2. Service specific L3 constructs which follow common architectural patterns. We will dive deeper into one such example pattern.
