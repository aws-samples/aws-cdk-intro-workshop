## Create project directory

Create an empty directory on your system:

```
mkdir cdk-workshop && cd cdk-workshop
```

## cdk init

We will use `cdk init` to create a new C# CDK project:

```
cdk init sample-app --language csharp
```

Output should look like this (you can safely ignore warnings about
initialization of a git repository, this probably means you don't have git
installed, which is fine for this workshop):

```
Applying project template sample-app for csharp
Projet 'CdkWorkshop/CdkWorkshop.csproj' ajouté à la solution.
Initializing a new git repository...
# Welcome to your CDK C# project!

You should explore the contents of this project. It demonstrates a CDK app with an instance of a stack (`CdkWorkshopStack`)
which contains an Amazon SNS topic that is subscribed to an Amazon SQS queue.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

It uses the [.NET Core CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/articles/core/) to compile and execute your project.

## Useful commands

* `dotnet build src` compile this app
* `cdk ls`           list all stacks in the app
* `cdk synth`        emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
* `cdk deploy`       deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
* `cdk diff`         compare deployed stack with current state
* `cdk docs`         open CDK documentation

Enjoy!

```

As you can see, it shows us a bunch of useful commands to get us started.
