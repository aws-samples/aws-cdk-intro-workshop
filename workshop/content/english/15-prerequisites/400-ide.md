One of the benefits of the AWS CDK is that you can leverage your favorite
development environments and have a rich experience when exploring the hundreds
of different services and features of AWS.

We highly recommend to use an IDE that supports code-completion and syntax 
highlighting for your language of choice:

 - [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) (recommended)
 - [AWS Cloud9](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9)
 - [Atom](https://atom.io/) with the [atom-typescript](https://atom.io/packages/atom-typescript) plugin
 - [vim](https://www.vim.org/) with [tsuquyomi](https://github.com/Quramy/tsuquyomi)
 - [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/webstorm/typescript-support.html)
 - [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) with the [tide](https://github.com/ananthakumaran/tide) mode
 - [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/)
 - [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/ide/)
