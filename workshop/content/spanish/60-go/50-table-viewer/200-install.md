## go install

Before you can use the table viewer in your application, you'll need to get
the go module:

```
go get github.com/cdklabs/cdk-dynamo-table-viewer-go/dynamotableviewer
```

Output should look like this:

```
go: upgraded github.com/aws/jsii-runtime-go v1.63.2 => v1.65.0
go: added github.com/cdklabs/cdk-dynamo-table-viewer-go/dynamotableviewer v0.2.248
```

----

Now we are ready to add a viewer to our app.
