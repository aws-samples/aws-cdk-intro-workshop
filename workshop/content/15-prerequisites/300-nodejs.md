The AWS CDK uses Node.js (>= 10.13.0, except for versions 13.0.0 - 13.6.0).
A version in active long-term support (14.x at this writing) is recommended.

* To install Node.js visit the [node.js](https://nodejs.org) website.

    * __Windows__: if you have an old version of Node.js installed on your
      system, it may be required to run the .msi installation as Administrator.

* If you already have Node.js installed, verify that you have a compatible version:

    ```
    node --version
    ```

    Output should be >= 10.13.0:

    ```
    v10.3.0
    ```
