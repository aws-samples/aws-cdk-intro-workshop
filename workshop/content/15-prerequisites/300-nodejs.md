The AWS CDK uses Node.js (>= 8.12.0).

* To install Node.js visit the [node.js](https://nodejs.org) website.

    * __Windows__: if you have an old version of Node.js installed on your
      system, it may be required to run the .msi installation as Administrator.

* If you already have Node.js installed, verify that you have a compatible version:

    ```console
    node --version
    ```

    Output should be >= 8.12.0:

    ```
    v8.12.0
    ```
