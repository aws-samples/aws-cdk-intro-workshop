If you are planning on using the Python Workshop, you obviously will need to
have Python installed.  Specifically, you will need version 3.6 or later.  You
can find information about downloading and installing Python
[here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

If you use Windows, be sure Python is on your PATH. To see if it is, type `python`
at a command prompt. The easiest way to make sure Python is on your PATH is to tick the
**Add Python 3.x to PATH** checkbox on the first screen of the Python installer wizard.
If you already have Python installed, but it's not on your PATH, you can add it by
editing the `PATH` environment variable. To edit environment variables, click the 
**Environment Variables** button in the Advanced page of Windows' System Properties.
(Quickest way to get there: press and release the Windows key, type **env**, and 
choose **Edit the system environment variables** from the Start menu.)
