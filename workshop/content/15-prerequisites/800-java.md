If you are planning on using the Java Workshop, you obviously will need to
have a JDK installed.  Specifically, you will need JDK 11 or later. You can find
information about downloading and installing the Amazon Corretto 11 distribution
[here](https://aws.amazon.com/corretto/). Other JDK 11 distributions are
available if you do not wish to use Amazon Corretto.
