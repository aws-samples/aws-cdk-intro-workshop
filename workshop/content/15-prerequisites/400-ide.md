One of the benefits of the AWS CDK is that you can leverage your favorite
development environments and have a rich experience when exploring the hundreds
of different services and features of AWS.

We highly recommend to use an IDE that supports TypeScript type annotations
(.d.ts files) or MyPy extensions if you are using Python:

 - [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) (recommended)
 - [AWS Cloud9](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9)
 - [Atom](https://atom.io/) with the [atom-typescript](https://atom.io/packages/atom-typescript) plugin
 - [vim](https://www.vim.org/) with [tsuquyomi](https://github.com/Quramy/tsuquyomi)
 - [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/webstorm/typescript-support.html)
 - [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) with the [tide](https://github.com/ananthakumaran/tide) mode
 - [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/)
