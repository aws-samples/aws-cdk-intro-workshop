## pip install

Before you can use the table viewer in your application, you'll need to install
the python module:

```
pip install cdk-dynamo-table-view==0.1.139
```

The last two lines of the output (there's a lot of it) should look like this:

```
Installing collected packages: cdk-dynamo-table-viewer
Successfully installed cdk-dynamo-table-view-0.1.139
```

----

Now we are ready to add a viewer to our app.
